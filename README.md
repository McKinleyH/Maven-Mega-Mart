Maven Mega Mart Acquisition Analysis

This project is a modified version of the midcourse project from the Maven course:  Data Analysis with Python and Pandas.

Maven Mega Mart is considering acquiring a new chain of stores.  Data was analyzed to determine the distribution of sales across customers, products, and stores.  

To determine suitability for acquisition Maven needs to learn; 1) Which products are generating the most sales,  2) who are the customers and how are sales distributed across the customer base, 3) which stores are generating the most revenue and which are underperforming.

The scope of this analysis did not seek to provide a definitive answer to the question of acquire or not to acquire. This analysis was for gaining insights into the potential strengths and weaknesses of the prospect based on the data provided and to shine a light on areas that require additional data for analysis and consideration.
